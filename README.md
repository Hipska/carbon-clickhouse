# carbon-clickhouse
Graphite metrics receiver with ClickHouse as storage

## Production status
Last releases are stable and ready for production use

## Build
```sh
# build binary
git clone https://github.com/lomik/carbon-clickhouse.git
cd carbon-clickhouse
make submodules
make
```

## ClickHouse configuration

1. Add `graphite_rollup` section to config.xml. Sample [here](https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/blob/master/dbms/src/Server/config.xml#L168). You can use [carbon-schema-to-clickhouse](https://github.com/bzed/carbon-schema-to-clickhouse) for generate rollup xml from graphite [storage-schemas.conf](http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config-carbon.html#storage-schemas-conf).

2. Create tables
```sql
CREATE TABLE graphite ( 
  Path String,  
  Value Float64,  
  Time UInt32,  
  Date Date,  
  Timestamp UInt32
) ENGINE = GraphiteMergeTree(Date, (Path, Time), 8192, 'graphite_rollup');
 
-- optional table for faster metric search
CREATE TABLE graphite_tree (
  Date Date,
  Level UInt32,
  Path String,
  Deleted UInt8,
  Version UInt32
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(Date, (Level, Path), 8192, Version);
```

[GraphiteMergeTree documentation](https://clickhouse.yandex/docs/en/table_engines/graphitemergetree.html)

You can create Replicated tables. See [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.yandex/docs/en/table_engines/replication.html)
